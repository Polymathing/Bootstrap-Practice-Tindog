# Bootstrap-Practice-Tindog

# What is TinDog?

Tindog is a "tinder website" made exclusively for Dogs. Tindog was created as a home page, and as a digital marketing strategy, it works like a charm.

# Tools Used
The main framework is Bootstrap and its components, such as: Carousel, Card, Buttons, Navbar and so on. Of course, HTML5, CSS3, Google Fonts and Font Awesome were also an integral part of this project.
